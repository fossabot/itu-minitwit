## Missing Implementations

We currently **lack the following features**:

- Completing our front-end design.
- Creating a CI/CD setup for your ITU-MiniTwit.

It would be **nice to have the following features**:

- 

## Weeks

### Week 1

Refactor ITU-MiniTwit to work on modern system.

- [x] 1) Adding Version Control.
- [x] 2) Try to develop a high-level understanding of ITU-MiniTwit.

- [x] 4) Share your Work on GitHub.

### Week 2

Refactor ITU-MiniTwit in another programming language and tech stack.

- [x] 1) Refactor ITU-MiniTwit to another language and technology of your choice.
- [x] 2) Containerize ITU-MiniTwit with Docker.
- [x] 3) Describe Distributed Workflow.

### Week 3

Continue refactoring, introduction of DB abstraction layer, and deployment of your ITU-MiniTwit to a remote server.

- [x] 1) Implement an API for the simulator in your ITU-MiniTwit.
- [x] 2) Continue refactoring of your ITU-MiniTwit.

### Week 4

Continue refactoring, Setup CI & CD for reproducible builds, tests, delivery, and deployment.

- [x] 1) Complete implementing an API for the simulator in your ITU-MiniTwit.
- [ ] 2) Creating a CI/CD setup for your ITU-MiniTwit.

## Course description

As a participant of the DevOps course at the IT University of Copenhagen, we are in for a hands-on learning experience. Every week, we will make changes to a Twitter project to put into practice the concepts and tools that we learn in class. Here is what we will be covering during this course:

- Bash: We will learn the basics of the shell, navigate the file system, and execute commands.

- Packaging applications: We will get hands-on experience with packaging applications for distribution and deployment.

- Containerization: We will learn how to create and manage containers to isolate applications and their dependencies.

- Virtual Machines: We will explore the use of virtual machines for testing, development, and deployment.

- CI/CD: We will understand the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, and implement them using popular tools such as Jenkins and GitLab.

- Monitoring: We will learn how to monitor the performance of our applications and infrastructure to ensure optimal operation.

- Maintainability: We will gain insight into making our applications maintainable, and understand the importance of clean code and testing.

- Log analysis: We will collect and analyze log data to identify and resolve issues in our applications.

- Web security: We will explore the importance of web security and the measures we can take to protect our applications and users.

- Scalability: We will understand the concept of scalability and learn how to design and implement scalable applications.

- Load balancing: We will balance loads across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.

- Infrastructure as Code: We will manage and provision infrastructure using code, and understand how this can improve the consistency and reliability of our deployments.

By the end of this course, we will have developed a solid foundation in DevOps concepts and practices, and will have the skills and confidence to build, deploy, and manage applications at scale.

\chapter{Introduction}

Throughout the course \textit{DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance}, the legacy Python-based Twitter application was migrated to a modern .NET-based application. Following the initial migration, the task at hand was to handle simulated users, which required the application of DevOps principles and practices in day-to-day development \cite{kim2016devops}. The system was designed to support fundamental functionalities of a Twitter application, such as user registration, login, post creation, follow requests, and viewing others' posts. The system was operated on a weekly basis, with new methods and strategies integrated into the system, such as continuous integration, delivery and deployment, logging, monitoring, and scalability, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of the importance of DevOps in managing software systems.
